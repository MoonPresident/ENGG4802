	\section*{\centering{Abstract}}
	In the face of breakdown in Moore's Law and Dennardian Scaling, Electrical and Computer Engineers are forced to reconsider the standard approach to circuit design. As a clear relationship of a doubling of performance every 1 and a half years gains the added caveat of doubling the power budget at the same time, the problem of dark silicon emerges, as sections of a chip go unpowered due to an inability to cool excess heat from the chip results would result in a shortened lifespan if all sections were powered.
	
	To combat the problem, an attempt was made to employ the dark silicon methodologies of heterogeneous core design, dynamic frequency scaling and memory driven computing, to produce a CPU with superior resource allocation tendencies in task scheduling.
	
	Due to the global health pandemic and several other mitigating factors, limited progress was made on this project, though a firm knowledge base and list of recommendations was compiled for future researchers to finish the project if so desired.
