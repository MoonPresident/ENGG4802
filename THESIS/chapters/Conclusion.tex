Due to a combination of factors, this project produced no meaningful results. Choosing a hardware oriented implementation made for a complex task, and attempts to reduce the complexity of the implementation only added unexpected complexities, resulting in a more complex implementation than intended. 

Future works on this subject should seek to remove all unnecessary complexity from the methodology, and seek to implement each hardware approach as soon as possible in order to weed out dead-end approaches.
