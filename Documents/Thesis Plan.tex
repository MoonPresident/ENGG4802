\section{Outline}
The current plan is to use the RPU core.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test core to confirm functionality
	\item Test for multicore potential
	\item Think up tests and key metrics to judge from
	\item Draw up schemes for hardware and software controllers for task scheduling
	\item Find linux distro that will run on this shitshow
	\item Figure out a comms protocol between the computer and the FPGA. I think there is a microUSB port that should do the trick.
	\item Configure RPU for sprinting.
\end{enumerate}
